**Competitive Programming (CP)**   
Felt that rush after suceeding in something, after failing it a hundred times? Crave that rush? 
Well if you answered yes to any of the above questions, CP is just the thing for you!  

*Purpose of this library:*  
Write *short*, *optimised*, *reuseable*, *easily customisable* code snippets that can be directly copied into the code, when importing a library isnt feasible.

*Coding style*
This lib uses a relatively terse coding style, with some macros and typedefs defined in the template, that will help shorten the code.

### Contribution Guide 📚  

*Currently not accepting contributions*
Got some fancy data structure templates or handy functions that can make a CP enthusiasts life easier? Feel free to add them! 😃 (Just make sure they are highly reuseable, compact and easy to understand)
