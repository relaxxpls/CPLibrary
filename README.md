**Competitive Programming (CP)**   
Felt that rush after suceeding in something, after failing it a hundred times? Crave that rush? 
Well if you answered yes to any of the above questions, CP is just the thing for you!  

*Purpose of this library:*  
Write *short*, *optimised*, *reuseable*, *easily customisable* code snippets that can be directly copied into the code, when importing a library isnt feasible.

*Coding style:*  
This lib uses a relatively terse coding style, with some macros and typedefs defined in the template, that will help shorten the code.

**Currently working on :**
1. Polynomial Library
    - ~~Add MultiPoint Evaluation~~  
    - Add Interpolation
    - Add exponentation
    - Add a switch to interchange at runtime between working in a finite feild (Modular Algebra + NTT) or the real space (decimal algebra + FFT)

2. Graph Algorithms Library
    - Euler Tour
    - Centroid Decomposition (Centroid Tree)
    - Heavy Light Decomposition

**Completed :**
1. Segment Tree Data Structure (Dec' 2020)
2. Coordinate Compression Algorithm (Oct' 2020)
3. Will post more soon!

**Sections:**

*MATHS*
- This section contains algorithms such as various highly optimised prime sieves (Bitwise Sieve), O(N^1/3) Factorization, Eulers Toitent Function, Primality Tests (Miller-Rabin), etc.

*Data Structures*
- This section will contain stuff like the Segment Tree(Sparse and Lazy), Matrix Library, Disjoint Set Union (DSU), Fenwick Trees, Li Chao Tree, etc. along with the working documentations (and maybe proofs for the same!)

*More to get added soon!*

### Contribution Guide üìö  

*Currently not accepting contributions*
Got some fancy data structure templates or handy functions that can make a CP enthusiasts life easier? Feel free to add them! üòÉ (Just make sure they are highly reuseable, compact and easy to understand)
